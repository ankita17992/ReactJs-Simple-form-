# ReactJs-Simple-form-
This is repo show dynamically generate the elements of the sample patient form and display the result of captured value.

Run command 'Npm install'
after that 'npm start' to run in local machine.

the project shows the elements act as seperate components into project and act dynamically to generate form.
i have added some validation for the same in app.js, however due to lack of time i could not added fully functionality.
Also as per requirement the captured data can be shown after when we run npm start and form display then put the commented div into the app.js file.

I have also make use of JSON file and the field value come from the file itself.
please Let me know if any questions.

Thank you.
